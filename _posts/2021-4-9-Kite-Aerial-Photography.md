My KAP Setup

I would love to have a drone to take some aerial photography but some national parks ban the use of drones (in the UK atleast elsewhere I dont know) and I can attest that they can be quite annoying sounding when you've come to enjoy the outdoors and not hear a drone buzzing around, they are also quite expensive so if you somehow lose it or it ends up in the sea, thats potentially £400 down the drain.

When I was looking at drones, I somehow stumbled upon something called Kite Aerial Photography or KAP for short and I thought it was a great alternative to drones, with a drone you are still able to take way better pics easier but for me the pros outweigh the cons.

Here is an example of some photos ive taken using my setup:

Obviously you would normally trying to keep the kite line out of the picture, as in the second picture.

### Setup

My setup consists of a cheap £30 action camera on a 3D printed gimbal with the commony used pendulum suspension method to keep the camera level.

The camera has a WiFi function that allows you connect to it with an app and see a preview/control capture etc, I used this WiFi hotspot to connect a microcontroller (ESP8266) to it and used servos to control the gimball (one continuous and one 180 degree one).

I am then able to control the gimball and see a preview/control capture at the same time, WiFi signal for the preview can be spotty if you let the camera out alot but normally standing right underneath it brings it back.
