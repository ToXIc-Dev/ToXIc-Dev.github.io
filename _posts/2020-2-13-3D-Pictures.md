title: 3D Pictures

Recently ive been working on making 3D pictures using 3D printing.

Here is a picture of one of them:

Please excuse the terrible paper background and boring paint job on this one, it was the first one I did.

Im pretty happy with it and my plan is to make a bigger one that is like 50cm wide and then make a wooden frame for it.

## Workflow

This is how I achieved this.

First I got the image I wanted to use, cut it down to size and removed the sky and made it white

Here are some progress pictures:

Then I put it into the wonderful [Lithophane maker](http://3dp.rocks/lithophane/) by [MarkDurbin104](https://github.com/MarkDurbin104)

I used these settings:

I then just 3D printed it at 0.2mm layer height using a 0.4mm nozzle

I hope this helps others to make cool little 3D pictures.
